**Current Status**: The project is structured for good maintainability.

## Recommendations for Excellence

### Immediate Actions (Next 1-3 Sprints) - CRITICAL PATH

1.  **Implement Core Gameplay Loop**: Focus on `GameEngine`, `Player` (control, basic visuals), one Trigram stance, one technique.
2.  **Basic UI Implementation**: `KoreanText`, `TrigramWheel` (selection only), Health display.
3.  **Write Unit Tests for Implemented Logic**: Start building actual test coverage.
4.  **Integrate Basic Audio**: Connect existing `AudioManager` to the first implemented actions with placeholder sounds.

### Medium-Term Goals (Next 3-6 Sprints)

1.  **Expand Combat System**: More stances, techniques, basic vital points.
2.  **Develop Training Mode**: For the implemented features.
3.  **Build Intro Screen**: Basic functionality.
4.  **Create/Source Initial Assets**: Key character sprites, UI elements, a few sound effects.
5.  **Achieve >50% Test Coverage** for all implemented code.

### Long-Term Vision (Beyond 6 Sprints)

(As previously outlined: VR, AI, Tournaments, etc., contingent on successful core implementation.)

## Quality Assurance Process

### Continuous Quality Monitoring (To Be Established)

- **Automated Testing**: CI/CD pipeline to run tests on every commit.
- **Manual Testing**: Regular playthroughs of implemented features.
- **Cultural Review**: Engage experts once content is available.
- **Performance Tracking**: Implement FPS counters and profiling.

## Conclusion

Black Trigram has an exceptionally strong architectural and conceptual foundation with a clear commitment to cultural authenticity. However, it is in a very early stage of development with the majority of its gameplay features and UI components yet to be implemented. The immediate focus must be on building out the core playable experience and incrementally increasing test coverage. The existing audio system code serves as a good example of the potential quality.

**Overall Assessment**: High potential, but significant implementation work is required. The project is more of a detailed blueprint than a functional application at this stage.
