Tests exist (`.test.tsx` files) but test very little due to lack of implementation. Coverage is effectively near 0% for actual logic.

### Game Module Recommendations

#### Priority 1: Core Implementation (Reiteration)

1.  **Complete GameEngine.tsx**: Implement game loop, physics, state management.
2.  **Build Player.tsx**: Korean martial artist with authentic techniques, states.
3.  **Create PlayerVisuals.tsx**: PixiJS rendering for player, traditional aesthetics.

#### Priority 2: Visual & UI Systems (Reiteration)

1.  **Implement HitEffectsLayer.tsx**: Damage effects, Korean numerals/symbols.
2.  **Enhance DojangBackground.tsx**: Dynamic traditional Korean training hall.
3.  **Complete GameUI.tsx**: HUD with Korean text, health/stamina/Ki bars, stance indicators.

#### Priority 3: Testing & Polish (Reiteration)

1.  **Write Meaningful Tests**: As features are implemented, write unit and integration tests.
2.  **Performance Optimization**: Target 60fps for combat.
3.  **Korean Cultural Validation**: Ensure authentic martial arts representation.

**Lines**: 60 total  
**Quality Score**: 4.0/10 (Structure for UI components is present, but implementations are missing)

### UI Component Structure

```
ui/
├── base/           (16) - Foundation UI components (all empty)
│   ├── KoreanText.tsx (4)
│   ├── BackgroundGrid.tsx (4)
│   └── BaseButton.tsx (4)
├── __tests__/      (24) - UI component tests (basic)
└── main files directly in ui/ (e.g. TrigramWheel.tsx (8), KoreanHeader.tsx (4), ProgressTracker.tsx (4) - all empty or minimal)
```

### Individual Component Analysis (Summarized)

`TrigramWheel.tsx`, `KoreanHeader.tsx`, `ProgressTracker.tsx`, and all components in `base/` are placeholders.

**Status**: 🚨 **Critical Gap** - Essential UI components for game interaction and information display are missing.

**Required Implementation**: As detailed previously, focusing on Korean themes, trigram interactions, and progress displays.

### UI Test Analysis

Tests are placeholders, checking for importability rather than functionality.

### UI Module Recommendations

#### Immediate Actions (Reiteration)

1.  **Implement KoreanText.tsx**: Foundation for all Korean typography.
2.  **Create TrigramWheel.tsx**: Central navigation/stance selection component.
3.  **Build ProgressTracker.tsx**: For player stats, health, Ki, etc.

#### Korean UI Standards (Reiteration)

1.  **Typography System**: Consistent Korean font (Noto Sans KR) usage.
2.  **Color Palette**: Traditional Korean color themes (from `KOREAN_COLORS`).
3.  **Layout Patterns**: Culturally appropriate design principles.
4.  **Accessibility**: Korean screen reader support.

## 🎬 `/src/components/intro/` - Introduction System Analysis

**Lines**: 44 total  
**Quality Score**: 3.5/10 (Skeleton structure, no implementation)

### Introduction Component Structure

```
intro/
├── IntroScreen.tsx           (4)  - Main intro component (empty)
├── components/              (16) - Intro sub-components (all empty)
│   ├── MenuSection.tsx      (4)
│   ├── ControlsSection.tsx  (4)
│   └── PhilosophySection.tsx (4)
└── __tests__/               (20) - Introduction tests (basic rendering/mock tests)
```

### Component Analysis (Summarized)

All components are empty shells.

**Status**: 🚨 **Critical Gap** - The entire introduction screen experience is unimplemented.

**Required Implementation**: As detailed previously, focusing on a Korean martial arts themed welcome, menu, controls explanation, and philosophy introduction.

### Introduction Test Analysis

`IntroScreen.test.tsx` (16 lines in `du`, but content is larger) uses mocks to simulate PixiJS elements. It tests for the _presence_ of text attributes, which would fail if the actual (empty) component were rendered directly.

### Introduction Module Recommendations

Focus on implementing `IntroScreen.tsx` with its sub-components, ensuring Korean cultural authenticity and providing a clear path for users to start the game or training.

## 📝 `/src/types/` - Type System Analysis

**Lines**: 36 total (includes `index.ts`, `pixi-react.d.ts`, `GameTypes.ts`)  
**Quality Score**: 7.0/10 (Good foundation, but needs more game-specific types)

### Type Structure

```
types/
├── index.ts         (12) - Main type exports (content provided is larger)
├── pixi-react.d.ts  (8)  - PixiJS React declarations
└── GameTypes.ts     (12) - Potentially redundant or specific subset of types
```

### Type Analysis

#### `index.ts`

(Content provided is comprehensive. The `CombatEvent` type has been added.)
The key is to ensure all game entities, states, and component props are strictly typed here.

#### `pixi-react.d.ts` (8 lines)

(Good quality as per previous analysis.)

#### `GameTypes.ts` (12 lines)

The content of this file is unknown. If it duplicates `index.ts` or contains outdated types, it should be consolidated or removed. Assume `index.ts` is the source of truth.

### Type System Recommendations

Ensure `index.ts` becomes the definitive source for all shared types. Add detailed types for:

- Player abilities, inventory, progression.
- Enemy AI states and behaviors.
- Detailed level/dojang structures.
- Game settings and configuration.

    ├── HitDetection.ts (12)
    ├── KoreanAnatomy.ts (16)
    └── KoreanVitalPoints.ts (12)
```

### Systems Analysis

- **`CombatSystem.ts`**: Likely a high-level orchestrator. Needs full implementation. Numerous type errors fixed, improving its structural integrity.
- **`TrigramSystem.ts`**: Manages stances and trigram-related logic. Decent base. Type errors in `TrigramSystem.test.ts` and the system itself have been addressed, improving reliability.
- **`VitalPointSystem.ts`**: Manages vital point mechanics. Needs full implementation. Type errors fixed.
- **`systems/trigram/`**: Contains more detailed logic for stances, techniques, transitions. Some files are placeholders (`KoreanCulture.ts`, `KoreanTechniques.ts`). `StanceManager` and `TrigramCalculator` have tests, suggesting some implementation.
- **`systems/vitalpoint/`**: Contains detailed logic for anatomy, hit detection, damage. These seem to be more developed than UI components.

### Systems Recommendations

1.  **Complete Implementations**: Flesh out `CombatSystem`, `VitalPointSystem`, and placeholder files in subdirectories.
2.  **Comprehensive Testing**: Add more unit tests for each system, covering all rules, calculations, and edge cases.
3.  **Integration Testing**: Test how these systems interact (e.g., Trigram stance affecting VitalPoint hit chance).
4.  **Data-Driven Design**: Ensure techniques, vital points, and trigram properties are loaded from data structures (e.g., in `types/index.ts` or JSON files) rather than hardcoded.
