Cultural Meaning & Linguistic Note:

In Korean, “Black Trigram” can be rendered as 흑괘 (Heuk-gwae), referring to one of the eight 괘 (Gwae, trigrams) used in 주역 (Juyeok / I Ching).

Each trigram symbolizes natural forces (e.g., fire, water, earth) and is traditionally depicted in 검은색 (black) lines — the black color denotes yin (broken) lines in the trigram diagram.
